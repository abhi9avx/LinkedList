1. Display Doubly Linked List 

........................

Given a doubly linked list of n elements. The task is to display the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1<->2<->3<->4<->5
Output:
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the given function displayList(), which takes head reference as argument and returns the doubly linked list as an array ( vector in cpp, ArrayList in java, list in python)
The driver's code print the list forward and backward.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 103
0 <= value of nodes <= 103
.......................

vector<int> displayList(Node *head)
{
    vector<int> v;
    Node *curr = head;
    while(curr->next != NULL)
    {
        v.push_back(curr->data);
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    v.push_back(curr->data);
    return v;
    
    
}
