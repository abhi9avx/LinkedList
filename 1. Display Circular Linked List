1. Display Circular Linked List

.....................................
Given a circular linked list of size n, you need to display the linked list. The tail of the linked list is connected to head.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4
(the last and the first node are connected,
i.e. 4 -> 1)
Output: 1 2 3 4
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2
(the last and the first node are connected,
i.e. 2 -> 1)
Output: 1 2
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function displayList() which takes head reference as argument and returns the circular linked list as a list.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

if(!head) return {};
   Node *t = head;
   vector<int> res;
   do{
       res.push_back(t->data);
       t = t->next;
   }while(t!=head);
   return res;
